**COLORED-LINES**

***ABOUT MY PROJECT***
<br />This project tells about a game called **Colored Lines**.
<br />Colored Lines is a single player board game which is generally played on a N x N grid.
<br />In this project I have created a 9 x 9 grid.

***RULES OF THE GAME*** 
1. Move the balls from cell to cell to group them into the lines of the same color. 
2. However, after each of your moves the computer drops three more balls onto the board. To avoid 
filling up the board you should gather the balls into lines of 5 or more balls. When such a line is 
complete, the balls are removed from the field and your score grows. 
3.The new balls will not be added to the field after a line removal. Instead you will be rewarded 
with yet another move before a new triplet of balls is added. 
4. The scoring system is quite simple – each removed ball gives you two points, but there is an extra 
bonus available. The goal of the “Color Lines” game is to stay in game as long as possible. The 
game ends once the whole game board becomes filled up with balls. 
5. ***Remember*** – the more balls you remove at once the greater your score is. You are playing against 
computer that cannot be won, so you compete against the highest score, yours or other players.
